# Bee Hive

## Overview

**Bee Hive** is a multi-agent platform designed to build, deploy, and serve powerful agentic workflows at scale. This repository contains implementations for both [TypeScript](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework) and [Python](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-hive/tree/main/framework/bee-py), enabling flexibility and interoperability for developers. The platform simplifies the creation and orchestration of AI agents powered by popular LLMs such as [Llama 3.x](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/) and [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite?adoper=255252_0_LS1).

## Key Features

* **üîì Open Platform**: Run and orchestrate agents seamlessly on an open platform designed for experimentation and scalability.

* **ü§ñ Flexible Agent Framework**: Write and experiment with agent and tool building in a flexible and modular framework.

* **‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Versatile Agent Orchestration Capabilities**: Design multi-agent workflows tailored to your specific needs.

* **‚ú® Optimized for Open-Source Models**: Achieve best-in-class performance against open-source models like IBM Granite and Llama 3.x

## Modules

This repository includes the following key modules:

1. Bee Agent Framework

    1.1 TypeScript

    The Typescript implementation of the Bee Agent Framework is available at: https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework

    1.2 Python

    The Python implementation focuses on scalability and ease of use for building agent-based workflows. Refer to the Bee Agent Framework Python [README](framework/bee-py/README.md) for details on installation, usage, and contributing.

2. Bee Hive

    The Bee Hive module serves as a multi-agent platform for orchestrating workflows. It supports declarative agent definitions and YAML-based workflows. Refer to the Bee Hive [README](bee-hive/README.md) for detailed instructions.

## Roadmap

* **API 2.0**: a powerful and lightweight API to help you integrate your agents

* **Dev UI**: build and optimize your agentic workflows in a developer-friendly UI

* **Additional multi-agent workflows**: conditionals, looping, async, meta-agent orchestration

* **Agent and tool library**: shareable assets to help you get started

* **Streamlined experience**: integrate key developer functionality in one repository
