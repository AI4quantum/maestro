            Build an agents.yaml file using the agent_schema tool as a reference.

            I want two agents, both using the llama3.1 model:

            weather_fetcher – Retrieves weather data for a given location using the OpenMeteo tool.
            temperature_comparator – Compares the retrieved temperature with historical averages using OpenMeteo.
            Ensure both agents are correctly formatted using the schema.
    steps:
      - name: Create Agent YAML
        agent: Create Agent YAML
      - name: input

                  Build a structured workflow using the workflow_schema tool as a reference.

                  I have two agents in agents.yaml:
                  weather_fetcher – Retrieves weather data for a given location using the OpenMeteo tool.
                  temperature_comparator – Compares the retrieved temperature with historical averages using OpenMeteo.

                  Requirements:

                  Ensure the workflow follows the workflow.schema.json format.
                  Each step must:
                  Reference a valid agent from agents.yaml.
                  Have a name that describes its function.
                  The final output should be a valid structured workflow in YAML format, please make it easily readble in a code block
