  <h4 align="center">Python implementation of the Bee Agent Framework for building, deploying, and serving powerful agentic workflows at scale.</h4>
</p>

The Bee Agent Framework Python makes it easy to build scalable agent-based workflows with your model of choice. This framework is designed to perform robustly with [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite?adoper=255252_0_LS1) and [Llama 3.x](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/) models. Varying level of support is currently availble for [other LLMs using LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). We're actively working on optimizing its performance with these popular LLMs.

Our goal is to empower Python developers to adopt the latest open-source and proprietary models with minimal changes to their current agent implementation.

## Key Features

- ü§ñ **AI agents**: Use our powerful Bee agent refined for Llama 3.x and Granite 3.x, or build your own.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Use our built-in tools or create your own in Python.
- ... more on our Roadmap

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install ./framework/bee-py
```

### Quick Example

```python
from bee_agent import BeeAgent, LLM

agent = BeeAgent(llm=LLM())

agent.run("What is the capital of Massachusetts")
```

> **Note**: To run this example, ensure you have [ollama](https://ollama.com) installed with the [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) model downloaded.

to run other examples you can use, "python -m examples.bee_agent.[example_name]":

```bash
python -m examples.bee_agent.basic
```

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-hive.git`
1. Change into the `./framework/bee-py` directory
1. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
1. Activate virtual environment: `poetry shell`
1. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill in required values


### Build the pip package

#### Build the package:

```bash
cd ./framework/bee-py
poetry build
```

#### Test the Build Locally (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv test_env

source test_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: test_env\Scripts\activate

# Install the built package
pip install dist/bee-py-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

#### Publish to TestPyPI

```bash
# Configure Poetry:
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
# Publish
poetry publish -r testpypi
#Test the installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bee-py
```

## Modules

The package provides several modules:

| Module   | Description                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `agents` | Base classes defining the common interface for agents |
| `llms`   | Base classes for text inference (standard or chat)    |
| `tools`  | Tools that an agent can use                           |

## Roadmap

- üë©‚Äçüíª **Code interpreter**: Run code safely in a sandbox container.
- üíæ **Memory**: Multiple strategies to optimize token spend.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Serialization**: Handle complex agentic workflows and easily pause/resume them without losing state.
- üîç **Instrumentation**: Full visibility of your agent's inner workings.
- üéõÔ∏è **Production-level** control with caching and error handling.
- üîÅ **API**: OpenAI-compatible Assistants API integration.
- Bee agent performance optimization with additional models
- Examples, tutorials, and comprehensive documentation
- Improvements to building custom agents
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Feature parity with TypeScript version
