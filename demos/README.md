Demos and use cases of Maestro

## Example environment setup using Podman Desktop, docker-compose, bee-stack, and local Ollama

### bee-stack setup

From a new terminal, clone the [bee-stack repo](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-stack) and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-stack.git
cd bee-stack
```

Before proceeding, the local environment requires a container engine along with compose.  In this case Podman Desktop is recommended.

### Podman Desktop setup

Download Podman Desktop here:
<https://podman-desktop.io/downloads>

Inside of Podman Desktop, make sure the latest version is selected. Then, go to Settings (bottom left) -> Preferences -> scroll down to Experimental (Docker Compatibility) and enable it.

### docker-compose

Installing podman desktop itself gives a platform to run, but we still need docker-compose itself to run the stack.

Install the matching architecture release of docker-compose: <https://github.com/docker/compose/releases>

Verify the installation by running: \
`docker-compose --version`

#### Possible docker-compose installation errors

1) Move docker-compose to the correct location, using a `sudo` command if neccessary

    `sudo mv ~/Downloads/docker-compose-darwin-aarch64 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
2) Make compose executable \
    `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

3) MacOS GateKeeper Warning: \
    1) System Settings -> Privacy/Security -> Scroll down to find error message and "Allow anyway"

### Ollama setup

By default, the .env file and api runs on llama version 3.1. Download ollama: <https://ollama.com/>
and navigate to llama3.1 model: <https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1>.
If using a different model, make sure to [change the model](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-stack?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-models) in the api connection (currently untested).
Verify Ollama is installed by running command `ollama list` in terminal.

### Create a Podman machine

`podman machine init`

Connect Podman with docker-compose, set as rootful, allocate enough memory (8GB or more), and then start machine (everytime you restart your computer): \

- `podman machine set --rootful` \
- `podman machine set --memory=12288`\
- `podman machine start`

Setup bee-stack: (Note: if you already have setup before and have created agents, skip this step and directly to start the stack)
`./bee-stack.sh setup`

If desired, use the different commands to run, stop, or clean bee-stack: \
`./bee-stack.sh start` \
`./bee-stack.sh stop`\
`./bee-stack.sh clean`

Nagivate to `localhost:3000` in order to run access the UI provided by bee-stack.

To save resources the Podman machine can be stopped and restarted later.
`podman machine stop`

#### Error Logging

Run `podman logs -f bee-stack-bee-api-1` in order to determine further errors with the api.

Test connection using:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{         
  "model": "llama3.1",
  "prompt": "Hello, world!"
}'
```

#### Allowing maestro to be run from anywhere

Create wrapper script: `nano ~/.local/bin/maestro`
Set the script path to run relative to your location, whereever in the terminal:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PYTHONPATH="/Users/REPLACEwUser/Desktop/work/bee-hive:$PYTHONPATH"
python3 -m maestro.cli.maestro "$@"
```

Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/maestro`
Verify maestro is running properly: `maestro --help`

##### SlackBot support

Please set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_TEAM_ID` as environment variables. See `./tests/yamls/agents/slack_agent.yaml` and `./tests/yamls/workflow_agent.yaml` for details. The output of slack message will be whatever is passed into the prompt.
