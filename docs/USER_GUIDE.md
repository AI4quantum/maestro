## Maestro Language

Maestro is a domain-specific language designed for creating and managing complex workflows. It consists of two main components:

- **Agents**: Agents are the building blocks of Maestro workflows. They represent entities that perform tasks, such as processing data, sending notifications, or invoking external services.

- **Workflow**: A workflow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of agents, defining the sequence and dependencies of tasks.

### Key Concepts

- **Task**: A single unit of work performed by an agent.
- **Dependency**: A relationship between tasks, where the execution of one task depends on the completion of another.
- **Parallelism**: The ability to execute multiple tasks concurrently.

## Maestro CLI

The Maestro Command Line Interface (CLI) allows users to define, execute, and manage workflows.

### Basic Commands

- `maestro init`: Initialize a new Maestro project.
- `maestro build`: Compile the Maestro workflow into an executable format.
- `maestro run`: Execute the compiled workflow.
- `maestro help`: Display help information for Maestro CLI commands.

## Maestro UIs

Maestro provides two user interfaces for visualizing and managing workflows:

- **Maestro Web UI**: A web-based interface for designing, executing, and monitoring workflows.
- **Maestro Visual Studio Code Extension**: An extension for Visual Studio Code, enabling Maestro workflow development within the code editor.

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Simple Sequential Workflow

```maestro
 
agent A {
  task t1 {
    // Task 1 logic
  }
}

agent B {
  task t2 {
    // Task 2 logic
  }
}

workflow w1 {
  A -> B
}
